■実世界でのPython
色々な分野で利用されている。

■ではなぜPythonなのか
人々がPythonを気に入ってるから

■Pythonを避けるべきとき
・スピードが必要な時
・要件が極めて過酷なアプリケーション
→そういう場合はGoを使う。

■Python2 VS Python3
今後の開発はPython3で進むのでPython3のほうが有利

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
